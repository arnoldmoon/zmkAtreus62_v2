A working ZMK Shield for the Atreus62 PCB from Profet Keyboard and the nice!nano v2 controller.

My first attempt was originally forked from this repo: https://github.com/zapling/zmk-atreus62 with changes made to the overlay to make it function.

This is a cleaned up version of my first attempt project using the Naked60 as a base instead.
